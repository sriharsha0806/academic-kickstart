 2022 is definitely a year to cherish in my life. This is my first blogpost, So I don't know where to start and How to end? I will start first with the most memorable event of this year. In April, I joined Basic Mountaineering Course at Nimas, Dirang. I learnt a lot from this course about mountaineering, The course instructors are army personnel. Although the stint was short and I failed to complete the course due to the physical demands of the course. I would like retry the course in the future by keeping these words close to my heart "Excellence happens not by accident but by process". I would like to thank my team and Bosch for providing me such a long break to join the course. 

I have started leetcoding, completed 150 medium problems and also achieved 100 day leetcode Badge. The journey was very rewarding, being from non cs background I am always on the look out for improving my coding skills. I also completed clean code principles course held for four months conducted by Bosch. I would like to apply the skills learnt in this year's project. To check my coding skills rather than using leetcode weekly challenge, I started using pramp website. I wanted to improve Ideation and dry run phase while solving the problem. I found pramp to be more helpful in addressing those than the leetcode challenges. 

One of my project's work finally got published in an internal Bosch Conference. I hope many more will come in the future. 
This year I had a personnel target of completing atleast two books. I completed one technical book Machine learning System design by Chip Huyen and one Biography book What it takes by Stephen A. Schwarzmann. Both books helped in improving technical and personal skills. If you are in ML field, I would definitely recommend Chip Huyen's book. What it takes is a must read book, The reason why I chose this book to read is while watching FINAIUS video covering black stone, he introduces Stephen Schwarzmann with House of Cards BGM. After reading the book all I could say is that's the best bgm available yet to introduce him, Hands down.

On physique, I started learning swimming and currently completed free style swimming.
